However, the problem with concurrent-threading-pool -executing is that it does not store the results in the same order, and the audio analysis responses of the songs do not contain the name or the id of the songs, so all the audio anaylsis links would be pointless since we cannot map it to the songs later on. Therefore, we can tweak the api response by including the song ID as an extra field within the API response itself, acting as if that is the response coming from the api, ensuring that with every audio analysis data, it has its own link with it as a key. This way, you don't need to create a separate mapping. To achieve this, you can modify the fetch_data function to include the song ID in the API response."
