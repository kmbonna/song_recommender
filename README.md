# This is an end to end content based song recommender prototype

A recommender system is a system that, no wonder, recommends content or items to users. The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. It can create useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual.

# About this Project:

In this project, this will be a content-based music recommender system. Meaning, it will not depend on a user's search history/likes,etc. But it will depend on the features of the input content (song) itself and based upon it will be recommending songs that are similar to that input song.

This is a streamlit application that takes an input song from the user and from it recommends various songs that are similar.
